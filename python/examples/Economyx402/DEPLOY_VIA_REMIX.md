## Alternative: Use Built-in USDC (No Deployment!)

Actually, **you don't need to deploy anything!** BSC already has USDC with EIP-3009:

**Use This (Already Live):**
- USDC: `0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d`
- Works NOW on BSC mainnet
- No deployment needed!

Just use your existing x402_a2a code - it's ready!
