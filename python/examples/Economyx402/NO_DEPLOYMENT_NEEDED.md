# âœ… NO DEPLOYMENT NEEDED!

## ðŸŽ‰ Good News

You can use **existing contracts** on BSC for x402 payments!

## Option 1: Use Existing USDC on BSC (Recommended)

USDC already supports EIP-3009 on BSC - no deployment needed!

```python
# Already deployed and live on BSC!
USDC_CONTRACT = "0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d"

# Just use it directly
from x402_a2a import create_payment_requirements

requirements = create_payment_requirements(
    price="$10.00",
    pay_to_address="0xYourWallet",
    resource="/service",
    network="bsc",
    asset=USDC_CONTRACT,  # Use existing USDC!
    description="Payment for service"
)
```

## Option 2: Use Test Configuration

For testing, you can use a test facilitator:

```python
# In server/agents/facilitator.py
USE_MOCK_FACILITATOR = True  # No deployment needed!
```

## Option 3: Deploy Later (Optional)

Only deploy if you need:
- Custom payment logic
- Your own facilitator
- Special features

For most users: **Use USDC directly - no deployment!**

## ðŸš€ Start Using BSC Now

You can start accepting BSC payments immediately:

```bash
cd python/examples/bsc-demo
python -m server
```

Then in another terminal:

```bash
python -m client_agent
```

## ðŸ’¡ Why No Deployment Needed?

- USDC on BSC already has EIP-3009
- You just need to configure it
- x402_a2a library handles the rest
- No smart contract needed for basic payments

## Next Steps

1. Configure your wallet address
2. Set network to "bsc"
3. Use USDC contract address
4. Start accepting payments!

No private key sharing needed. No deployment required. Just works! âœ…
